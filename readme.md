# petter-init

## What is petter-init?

petter-init is a cmd-line tool you can use to easily scaffold projects in your favorite front-end frameworks, with tailwindcss configured ready-to-go. It automatically does all the steps needed to start using tailwind in your framework.

You can immediately style your elements using tailwindcss.

## Why petter-init?

Initializing projects and setting up tailwindcss everytime you have a new idea can be tiresome. I myself realized I spent 5 minutes just setting up tailwindcs everytime I created a new front-end project. Therefore, I decided to take it upon myself to create **petter-init**.

The name is a play on "better-init", but as it was taken on npm, I decided to use my own name, Petter.

## How do I use it?

1. Download the npm package globally as such `npm install petter-init -g`.
2. Use `petter-init --help` to see all options.
