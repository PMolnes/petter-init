# Getting Started

## Installation

Install petter-init globally using:

```
npm install petter-init -g
```

### Prerequisite

For petter-init to work with [yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/#mac-stable) and [pnpm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pnpm) you need to have them both installed globally as well.

## How to use

1. After installation, in your terminal you can run:

```
petter-init
```

2. Complete the setup through the CLI.
3. `cd` into your new project directory, and run your project.

That's it. Now you can write utility classes with TailwindCSS instantly.
